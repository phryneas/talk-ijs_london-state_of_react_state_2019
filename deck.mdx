# A brief warning:

## This talk might already be outdated...

Especially third-party-library hooks APIs mentioned in this talk are all alpha and subject to change (and they do!)

---

# We need to look at:

- Different types of State in React Apps
- Common options for State management
- What kind of management to use for what kind of state

---

# Different types of State in React Apps

- configuration (language, theme etc.)
- login/user information
- input/form State
- UI State (toggles etc.)
- API Cache
- calculated values

---

# But first...

## What do we look at - and Why?

---

# State Types

<Split>

## What

## Why

</Split>

<Split>
<Fragment>

- global
- semi-global
- semi-local
- local

</Fragment>

<Fragment>

- more global state
  - easy to see application state at one glance
  - difficult to attribute accountability
  - might trigger re-rendering of a lot of Components
- more local state
  - difficult to get "the big picture"
  - clear responsibilites

</Fragment>

</Split>

<Notes>

- _global_: the whole application depends on it
- _semi-global_: large parts of the application depend on it
- _semi-local_: one small component tree depends on it
- _local_: only one component depends on it

"accountability" comment:

- what triggers state changes
- which team is responsible

"big picture" comment:

- no time travel etc

</Notes>

# How often does a State change

## Why

State that impacts a lot of Components AND changes often might lead to performance problems.

---

# How is it initialized

<Split>

## What

## Why

</Split>

<Split>

<Fragment>

- no initialization
- default values
- values from storage
- values from asynconous sources
- derived when it is first required

</Fragment>

<Fragment>

Sometimes State initialization should be triggered before the App starts rendering. This might affect your choice of state management solution.

</Fragment>

</Split>

---

# How State updates are triggered

<Split>

## What

## Why

</Split>

<Split>

<Fragment>

- Application Lifecycle
- Component Lifecycle
- User Interaction

* synchronously or asynchronously

</Fragment>

<Fragment>

This might impact your choice of State management.

Not every of these combinations is easily possible with every solution.

</Fragment>

</Split>

---

# Configuration (language, theme etc.)

- affects almost all of your Components
- this is _true global state_
- changes _rarely_
- usually initialized _from storage_
- changes are triggered _from somewhere in the Component tree_

---

# User authentication State

- used in some Components, in different parts of your applications
- most likely, you even use this state outside of React
- this is _true global state_
- changes _rarely_
- usually initialized _from storage_
- changes are triggered _asynchronously_ through user interaction

---

# Input or form State

- contains:
  - user input
  - validation results
- while the form is displayed: _local state_
- final results of the user input might become relevant outside of this form
  - in that case, the result later becomes _global_ or _semi-global_
- changes _often_
- usually initialized with _default values_
- changes are triggered from a _close component_

---

# UI State (toggles etc.)

- usually _local state_
- if you want to keep some UI state while the component is not mounted, this becomes _semi-global_
- if a component might be rendered twice at the same time, this is definitely _local state_
  - in that case, storing it in a _semi-global_ fashion might require you to track _component state identity_
- usually initialized with _default values_
- changes are triggered from a _close component_

---

# API cache

- can be _global_ or _local_
- can contain denormalized or normalized values
- usually initialized _empty_
- changes are triggered _asynchronously_, with or without user interaction
- should get _invalidated_

---

# Calculated values

- derived values
- can always be recomputed using other values available to the Component
- only kept because computation is expensive
- usually _local_, sometimes _global_

---

# Let's get the elephant out of the room: Cache state

## If you use GraphQL

you won't have to worry about Cache

---

# Let's get the elephant out of the room: Cache state

## If you **don't** use GraphQL

- if you can keep your Cache for a part of your API local, this might be worth a try
  - Cache invalidation takes place as the component holding state is unmounted
- but as soon as two Components in different subtrees need access to the same API, you have to go global state or risk going out of sync
- there is no good library I know of to handle this in the REST world - you'll have to do your own and handle it like all your other global State
- this talk will not cover more on Cache State

---

# And something else... Form State

- managing Form state is not very much fun... but, there are good libraries for that!
- take a look at Formik or React-Final-Form for example

---

# What are we left with?

- highly depends on your applications
- usually:
  - not very much real global state
  - some semi-global state
  - a lot of local or semi-local state

## let's see how to approach such a scenario

---

# How far can we get with React alone?

From now on, we're in hooks & demo territory

# Best practices

- Learn useReducer early - it's much more powerful than useState
- Lift your State up to a common Parent for related State, instead of keeping duplicate State in sync
- Prevent prop drilling by composing Components near the Component you lifted State up to - representational Components can just receive _children_
- If you get too much prop drilling, start using Context
- Use Context as low in your Component tree as possible - no need to move everything to the root

# Limitations of using only React

---

# Limitations of using only React

Having a lot of different/unrelated state in one often-subscribed Context Provider might cause many unnessary re-renders.

Splitting up that big Context Provider into smaller ones might lead to a Cascade of Context Providers.

---

# Limitations of using only React

Alternatively, you can keep just one Context Provider and handle _subscriptions_ yourself.

This will very likely lead to problems with the upcoming React Concurrent mode. This _will_ cause you pain.

---

# Limitations of using only React

You can't just "plug in" new Context Providers after your App starts rendering.

---

# Limitations of using only React

While performing an asynchronous action, there's no way to get the _current state_ like you could in most libraries through a middleware.

---

# So...

## These limitations don't bother you? ü§∑

### ‚û°Ô∏è You are already using a pretty good state management solution: React

## You want more and you don't want to write your own State management solution? (Please, don't!)

### ‚û°Ô∏è Let's take a look at libraries

---

# MobX

---

# MobX

- state objects are _obserables_
- components are _observers_ by using the **@observer** annotation or the **useObserver** hook
- has _computed values_: lazily evaluated derived values
- _asynconous actions_ can be handled in with **flow**
- any number of small MobX stores can co-exist in one application and easily passed down with **Provider** and **inject**
- can use _reactions_ for side effects

---

# MobX

- very un-opinionated: either modify state objects directly or use the safer "enforce actions" mode
- data-flow can be very un-react-like as it breaks top-down dataflow
  - this is in line with the mission of MobX: "to make React more reactive"
- can also be used for local State with the `useLocalStore` hook (or just observable class properties)

---

# MobX-State-Tree

---

# MobX-State-Tree

- builds on MobX
- very opinionated
- requires definition of typesafe models (checked at runtime in dev builds)
- per default, "enforced actions" mode is on, rejecting direct updates to the tree
- works "copy-on-write" out of the box, creates **snapshots** between states
- a **view** on your model contains all computed values
- models have _lifecycle_ hooks for creation/destruction, attaching/detaching and snapshot events
- allows for use of action listeners and middlewares

---

# Redux & Redux-Starter-Kit

---

# Redux

- unidirectional data-flow:
  - components _dispatch_ actions.
  - dispatched actions are passed together with the last state into a _reducer_ function to generate the new state
  - state should never be mutated, but always be created as a mutated copy
- _middleware_ can hook between dispatch and reducer to block actions and/or execute side-effects and dispatch further actions
- components are either _connected_ to the state using a HOC or use the _useSelector_ and _useDispatch_ hooks
- usually one Redux state per application

---

# Redux-Starter-Kit

- **this is from the makers of Redux!**
- too many choices out there? _redux-starter-kit_ is _opinionated_
- includes _redux-thunk_ as default middleware
- includes _immer_ for "copy-on-write" reducers
- includes _selectorator_ for selectors
- devTools enabled out of the box
- includes quality-of-life functions like **configureStore**, **createSelector**, **createAction** or **createReducer**
- adds the _slice_ concept with **createSlice** to unify creation of _reducer_, _action creators_ and _state initialization_ in one simple API
  - this massively reduces boilerplate code

---

# Client-side State in Apollo-Client

- stores State in the Apollo Cache
- can be subscribed using GraphQL queries and the `@client` directive
- State modification by
  - either directly modifying the Cache
  - creating local Mutation resolvers (that modify the Cache)
- everything in Apollo-Client is normalized
  - so you will have many State types with only one instance and `id: 1`
- writing local Mutation resolvers feels a bit clunky
- no middlewares
  - but asynchronous Mutation/Query resolvers are allowed

---

# A word on testing

- if possible, move everything out into a **useStateForThisComponent** hook
- you can inject this as a prop default value into your component and easily mock it away in your tests

```
function useStateForThisComponentOriginal(){ /*...*/ }

function MyComponent({useStateForThisComponent = useStateForThisComponentOriginal}) {
  const { /*...*/ } = useStateForThisComponent();
}
```

- but keep in mind: only mock away state that comes from higher up in the tree
  - do not mock local state modifications done by your Component
  - ‚û°Ô∏è **test behaviour, not implementation!**
- as a side effect, that even allows you to change your State management solution without even touching your Components üôÉ
